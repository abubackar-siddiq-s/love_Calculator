# Love Percentage Calculator ❤️

A fun and simple web app to calculate the love percentage between two people! Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

## Features
- Enter your name and your lover's name
- Get a deterministic love percentage based on your names (same names always give the same result)
- Fun love level messages based on the calculated percentage

## How the Calculation Works
- The app uses a deterministic algorithm based on the Unicode values of the combined names, so the same pair always gets the same result.
